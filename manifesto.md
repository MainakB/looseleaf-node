## LooseLeaf Manifesto

The ultimate vision is for LooseLeaf to supersede a college education or internship for gaining the skills and credibility needed to find employment. What LooseLeaf needs for early adopters are those who see the value and have the motivation to earn their credibility as an app developer, freelance writer, or graphic designer through working on projects for people pro bono. Of course they will not be the paying customers. 

The paying customers would be the ones commissioning the work (maybe pay a flat fee to LooseLeaf to gain the ability to post these jobs and get others to work on them for free). There's more value for those paying customers using LooseLeaf because they pay a flat fee for the ability to get multiple "wannabe" programmers/writers/designer to work on their projects and get to choose the best one at the end to reward "extra credits" to.  Everyone who submits something before the deadline gets credits for having completed the work. Every little effort counts and LooseLeaf let's you advertise all your efforts on your LooseLeaf profile page, which I'm envisioning as something resembling Github, but itemizes the type of work you complete by chunking them into skill sets and knowledge areas. 

LooseLeaf is better than the alternatives for the people trying to earn credibility as a professional (e.g., college, internship, coding boot camp) because (1) it's free, (2) there's no barrier of entry, (3) there's no consequence for dropping out or switching "majors" (contrary to college where you accumulate more debt if you need to take longer to get a degree because you changed your major in your junior year). 

LooseLeaf is better than the alternatives for the paying customers  (e.g., hiring a freelancer or an employee, do it yourself) because the paying customer does not need to waste valuable time shopping around or hiring a recruiter to find the best candidates. They simply declare what they want accomplished and people accomplish them. I need to refine the constraints for those "jobs". They have to be small so not a year long effort, can be accomplished by someone who is still learning, and specific enough (with a clear set of goals) such that people know how to complete it. To refine it, I need to deploy the webapp and get people to use it so I can observe how they use it and generalize a pattern.

Once LooseLeaf gains enough users, there can be other sources of income from actual recruiters and companies looking to hire qualified candidates. Recruiters can use LooseLeaf to keep track of the progress of wannabe who has a lot of potential but lack the experience and credibility to be an employee for the company looking for qualified candidates. Companies themselves can post jobs as a way to shape the potential pool of the prospective employees and influence them to, on their own, obtain the skills that would be useful to the company. This is better and a lot cheaper than the alternative of throwing a lot of money at recruiting or training programs for new hires. Companies can also use this platform to implementing a continuing training program for their existing employees.

So far, I talked about 3 groups of people who will be using LooseLeaf (1) wannabes, (2) people who posts jobs for wannabes, and (3) recruiters/companies (early majority or late majority). There's one more group - (4) the mentors.

Who are the mentors? They are people who likes to write about what they know and teach and guide others through their blogs, publications (books, articles), or social media. They are characterized by their in depth knowledge in a specific knowledge area and their willingness to share what they know with others. They do that altruistic reasons or to gain influence and followers. These people look for an audience and potential customers who will buy their books or donate to keep their blogs going. LooseLeaf gives them that audience - the wannabes. In turn they give the wannabes guidance and support (in addition to the mutual support that wannabes of the same aspiration give to each other).

## FAQ
**More experienced wannabes will dominate all the jobs, if the best submissions are the ones selected by the client or you (looseleaf). How will you level the playing field for novice programmers?**

All wannabes can submit work to any job post. Once they submit, they get credit for it. If their work was picked to be the best by the creator of the job post, they get extra credit. Both the credit and the extra credit get logged to your profile. Extra credit is bonus but not necessary. Think of it like class in college. There’ll be someone who’s better than you on an exam but if you earned > 90, you get an A. More people getting As in the class doesn’t take away your A. Your “level” as a wannabe is based on cardinal, not ordinal metrics.

**for the people trying to earn credibility as a professionals is this strictly for technology jobs or does it cross over into other fields such as agriculture, construction, services, etc..?**

I envision technology jobs would be a compelling reason for early adopters to use LooseLeaf. I haven’t thought about agriculture, construction, and those other services but that’s not out of the question if there’s a need for a online platform to learn these skills.

**I do like the idea as a platform to get free lancers to do work, as I put together this non-profit that is a common problem that I have getting people to help me with tasks such as grant writing, developing business plans, etc... In other words I could use that service now.**

You gave me an idea with using LooseLeaf to support nonprofits. I also haven’t thought about tasks such as grant writing and developing business plans, which are opportunities for budding business students to prove themselves.

**As far as marketing I would ask you what is the end game do you have in mind. Do you want to run the loose leaf as it grows or do you want to develop the technology and sell it to another firm like Facebook (That was my first thought when I was introduced to loose leaf and what it can do)? I ask this cause that would entail on how you would approach your target audience, either way you are on the right track running a pilot project to gain a proof of concept which can be used to market it to investors and users as well.**

One option for my end game would be to get acquired by LinkedIn. LooseLeaf’s customers include recruiters and companies looking for talent. There is some overlap with LooseLeaf. I can picture acquisition by Facebook being another end game since LooseLeaf is more social networking and community building than other edtech companies, which offer content and seek to be a cheaper alternative of college.
